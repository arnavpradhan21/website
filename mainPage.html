  <h1>MrBeast</h1>
  <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0016/1975/5059/files/MrBeastLogo_400x100_Blue_410x.png?v=1525134288">
  <h2>History</h2>
  <h3>The Beginning</h3>
  <p>Jimmy Donaldson was born in Greenville, North Carolina on May 7, 1998. Jimmy started his youtube channel, MrBeast, with the help of his friend,
    Chris. He started his channel on February 19, 2012. He got fame through his "Worst Intros Ever" videos. These videos poked fun at the funniest and worst intros on Youtube. These videos were very popular, and MrBeast got lots of views on these videos. However, these videos didn't get him to where he wanted to be.</p>
  <h3>2017-2018</h3>
  <p>Time went by, and MrBeast didn't gain many subscribers in that time. However, he started to upload more content. Most of the new content on his channel was very original. A lot of the videos on his channel were very original, but some called him a clickbaiter(a clickbaiter is someone who puts a fake image in the thumbnail that is not in the video at all). However, MrBeast continued to post more videos. Most of his videos were about donating to twitch streamers, trying out interesting experiments, and challenge videos. However, people were angry at MrBeast for also spending too much money on videos, and use them for a better cause. At this point, MrBeast donated to charity streamers, but also made entertaining and original content. Some of these video include "I Donated $50,000 to Ninja- Fortnite" and "I Put 100 Million Orbeez in My Friends Backyard."</p>
  <h3>Pewdiepie vs. T-Series</h3>
  <img src="https://www.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pewdiepie_youtube_billboard.jpg">
  <p>Recently, many people have been following the social media battle of Pewdiepie and T-Series. These two Youtube channels are fighting for the top spot on Youtube. Getting on with the trend, Youtubers have been starting to make videos to start supporting Pewdiepie. This also included MrBeast. MrBeast believed that Pewdiepie was the Youtube King, and wanted him to have more subs than T-Series. As a result, MrBeast made videos that advertised Pewdiepie. These videos were titled "I Bought Every Billboard to Do This." and "Saying Pewdiepie 100,000 Times." He has spent lots of time and money to advertise Pewdiepie and spread the word to subscribe to him. As a result, Pewdiepie gained more subscribers, and was able to widen the gap between Pewdiepie and T-Series.
  <h2>Content</h2>
  <h3>Worst Intros Ever</h3>
  <p>"Worst Intros Ever" is what brought MrBeast's channel more views. These videos looked at multiple Youtube videos and looked for the worst introductions to videos. They were very funny videos that poked fun at others. It was some of the first times that people that people talked about intros to other videos. However, MrBeast has made the videos private as of August 2018, due to how old they are. There are no further plans of bringing back the videos.</p>
  <h3>Giving Money to People</h3>
  <p>These videos include MrBeast giving large sums of money for good or useless reasons. Most of the times, he gives free money to hard-working people. However, he has wasted money in the past by donating to random twitch streamers. However, one of the best donations he has made was during the Ninja charity live stream. During this video, MrBeast donated $50,000 on a charity live stream hosted by Ninja. The money would go to a hospital for research of cancer. However, most of the videos is giving excessive tips, or excessive amounts of money to people. Some of cash spending is dumb. In one of his videos, MrBeast spent $50,000 on scratch tickets, and only made up $30,000 dollars. He just has to hope he is making it back in revenue.</p>
  <h3>Competition Videos</h3>
  <p>In these videos, MrBeast's friends participate in wild competitions to win large sums of money, or other things. He has done it multiple times. Some of the competitions are staying in a pool of slime, touching a lamborghini, and staying in a small video. He also just challenge videos with his subscribers. Depending on which subscriber they are, he challenges them to do something. When they complete it, they win multiple prizes.</p>
  <h3>Experimenting Videos</h3>
  <p>Throughout the year, MrBeast posted crazy experimental Youtube videos were they tried doing very unique challenges that no one had really seen before. These videos have very unique concepts that no other content creators have. Some stuff include staying in a pool for a whole day, building a car out of legos, and more amazing and original content. These videos are posted almost weekly and are very interesting.</p>
  <h2>Downsides of MrBeast</h2>
  <h3>Clickbaiting</h3>
  <p>Recently, MrBeast was accused of being a clickbaiter, and putting fake thumbnails on his videos. A clickbaiter is someone who puts something inaccurate and something that is not in their in the thumbnail. Clickbaiters are given very negative connotations. However, most of the thumbnails from MrBeast are not clickbaiting material. Instead their pictures or parts of the video that wasn't shown in the video.</p>
  <h3>Wasting Money</h3>
  <p>In lots of MrBeast's videos, MrBeast used a lot of money on the video to either purchase the item or giving the money. This has angered a lot of people. People are angry because he is wasting money for his own good. He is able to give the money away, but he uses it for his own value and profit. This angered many and changed their views about Mr. Beast.</p>
